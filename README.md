#### Python Maze Solver

This is a maze solver using depth first and breadth first searches to solve a
maze imported from a text file.

Notes for use:

- nodes.py is designed to contain all code common to other files in the project.
- nodes.py is imported into depthFirstSearch.py and breadthFirstSearch.py
- There is a Node class in nodes.py which is used to construct a search tree, 
    - therefore do not run either without nodes.py
